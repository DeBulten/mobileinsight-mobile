MobileInsight Mobile Version
==============

This repository includes the codes to build MobileInsight mobile version. It wraps the MobileInsight monitor and analyzer modules (`mobileinsight-core`) into an Android application, and provides key utilities (UI, log collection/viewer, protocol analyzer, plugin service etc.) to faciliate in-device use. 

The structure of this repo is organized as follows:

```
.
├── README.md: this file
├── Makefile: Makefile which supports multiple compilation options
├── deploy.py: configures compilation environments
├── config: codes for application specific configurations
├── app: main directory for the MobileInsight app
├── diag_revealer: in-device raw cellular message extracter
└── resources: application icon and welcome screen
```


## Quickstart

It is strongly recommended to use the standalone Vagrant configuration file to automatically download `mobileinsight-mobile` repo and configure the development environment. The `Vagrantfile` will automatically fire up a virtual machine and configure everything. It is tested on Ubuntu 14.04/16.04, macOS 10.11/10.12, and Windows 7/10.

First, install `virtualbox` and `vagrant`. You can follow the instructions at [VirtuBox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).

Second, obtain the newest `Vagrantfile` for MobileInsight development from the [release page](https://github.com/mobile-insight/mobileinsight-dev/releases). You should put it under your development path, say `/path/to/dev`. Run the `Vagrantfile` and install the virtual image using `vagrant up`. 

```
cd /path/to/dev
wget https://github.com/mobile-insight/mobileinsight-dev/archive/v1.0.tar.gz
tar -xf v1.0.tar.gz mobileinsight-dev-1.0/Vagrantfile
mv mobileinsight-dev-1.0/Vagrantfile .
rm -r mobileinsight-dev-1.0
vagrant up
```

Depending on the network and CPU speed, the installation may take half hour or longer.

Then, when the process finish install and returns the shell, a MobileInsight app is already compiled and copied to your path (`/path/to/dev`). You can install it on supported Android phone and try it out immediately using `adb`.

```
adb install MobileInsight-3.0.0-debug.apk
```

For more details on using the provided `Vagrantfile` to configure the MobileInsight, please refer to the [`mobileinsight-dev` repo](https://github.com/mobile-insight/mobileinsight-dev).


## Usage

Once the development virtual machine is installed, you can login and recompile the app with your customized changes.

First, run `vagrant ssh` to login to the virtual machine. By default, everything is installed under the `/home/vagrant/mi-dev` folder.

```
(host shell) $ cd /path/to/dev
(vm shell)   $ vagrant ssh
(vm shell)   $ cd mi-dev
```

The version and icon etc. of the MobileInsight app are configured by `config/config.yml` file.

Next, you can compile the new apk using `make`:

```
make apk_debug
```

If you want to sign your application, you need to specify the correct keystore path in `config/config.yml` file, and use

```
make apk_release
```

We have provided an example keystore at `config/example.jks`. The passwords are:

```
Passphrase for keystore: mobileinsight
Key password for mi3: mobileinsight
```

The compiled APK can be copied out of the virtual machine and installed by copying to the `/vagrant` folder.

```
(vm shell)   $ cp MobileInsight-3.0.0-debug.apk /vagrant
(vm shell)   $ exit
(host shell) $ adb install -r MobileInsight-3.0.0-debug.apk
```

__NOTE__: If upstream core functionalities of MobileInsight ([`mobileinsight-core`](https://github.com/mobile-insight/mobileinsight-core)) changed, you need to clean the existing MobileInsight *distribution* and re-compile it:

```
make clean_dist
make dist
```

The newly compiled distribution will be called `<dist_name>` (in `config/config.yml`) and be stored in `<p4a_path>/dists/<dist_name>`.
These steps are only required to be performed once if the core functionalities changes. More details on distribution can be found in [`python-for-android`'s documentation](https://python-for-android.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/#distribution-management).


## Manual Installation

The recommend way to install the `mobileinsight-mobile` repo and set up the environment is through our provided Vagrantfile. However, if you need to install and configure it on your host machine for performance or whatever reason, please follow the __exact__ instructions below. We have tested these steps on macOS 10.12 and Ubuntu 14.04/16.04.

1. Install the special version of `python-for-android`.

`mobileinsight-mobile` uses `python-for-android` as the backend building tool. We added a `mobileinsight` **recipe** into the `python-for-android` repo and fixed some bugs to support the core functionality of `mobileinsight-core`.

```
git clone https://github.com/mobile-insight/python-for-android.git
cd python-for-android
python setup.py install
```

2. Install Android SDK.

Please follow [Google's official instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). Please install following packages using the SDK manager:

```
platform-19 (API-19)
platform-tools (ver. 26.0.0)
build-tools (ver. 25.0.3)
```

If the installed SDK tool version is higher than `v25.2.5`, replace the latest SDK tools `$ANDROID_SDK_HOME/tools` with SDK tools version 25.2.5 to use `ant`. You may download it from:

```
Windows: https://dl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.5-windows.zip
macOS:   https://dl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.5-macosx.zip
Linux:   https://dl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.5-linux.zip
```

Currently MobileInsight relies on __exactly__ Android SDK API level 19 and `ant` to compile the app. We are testing the latest API level 25 and new `gradle` compilation toolchain.

3. Install Android NDK r10e.

Please download the __exact__ version of Android NDK r10e from [Google's archive page](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases.html). Currently MobileInsight relies on  __exactly__ Android NDK r10e to compile the app. We are testing the latest NDK r15 to switch to `clang` toolchain.

4. Install other dependencies.

MobileInsight mobile version compilation dependends `python-for-android`, which requires:

+ git
+ build-essential
+ ant
+ python2
+ cython (version 0.25.2)
+ a Java JDK
+ zlib (including 32 bit)
+ libncurses (including 32 bit)
+ libtool
+ unzip
+ virtualenv
+ ccache
+ PyYaml
+ xmltodict

On Ubuntu, you can install them with

```
apt-get -y install build-essential git unzip ant ccache
apt-get -y install autoconf automake
apt-get -y install zlib1g-dev libtool ccache
apt-get -y install openjdk-8-jdk openjdk-8-jre
apt-get -y install python2.7-dev python-setuptools
apt-get -y install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 libbz2-1.0:i386 lib32z1 zlib1g:i386
pip install cython pyyaml xmltodict
```

On macOS, you can install them with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), such as:

```
brew cask install java
brew install git python zlib libtool ant ccache autoconf automake
python -m pip install cython pyyaml xmltodict
```

5. Clone this repository and create config file.

```
git clone https://github.com/mobile-insight/mobileinsight-mobile.git
cd mobileinsight-mobile
make config
nano config/config.yml
```

You need to cutomize the configurations, especially specifying the path of your Android SDK/NDK and `python-for-android` storage path. 
Then, you can follow the usage guide and compile the application. Basically, you can invoke

```
make dist
make app_debug
```
